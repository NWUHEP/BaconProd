BaconProd
=========

Package for producing bacon files

 * Depends on BaconAna package
 * Place package in `$CMSSW_BASE/src` area

Run setup script after setting CMSSW environment:

```Shell
source BaconProd/scripts/setup_prod.sh
```

This branch is the same as tags/04, but I have added the MVA b tagger.  I have tested that it works with CMSSW_5_3_20, but was unable to get it to compile in earlier releases.
